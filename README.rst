Topic Modeling with Gensim
==========================

Model that extracts hidden semantic structures from large volumes of text.

Features
--------

* Groups words together into topics
* Uses `Gensim`_, which deploys memory-independent algorithms w.r.t. the corpus size (can process input larger than RAM, streamed, out-of-core)
* Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to induce probabilistic topics
